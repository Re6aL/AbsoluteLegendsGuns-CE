<description>Makes Abso-Lutely legendary pistols CE compatible as they were intended from the start.

Originally the mod was intended for CE only, but later i decided to split it into Mod+Patch for vanilla people. I personally couldnt stand vanilla after i found CE, but someone can disagree with this</description>
